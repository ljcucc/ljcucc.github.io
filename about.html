  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I'm Jason Lin, The abbreviation is ljcucc (LinJason.cu.cc). I'm a high school student from Taiwan who keen to programming.
      <br><br>
      And I having a quite of long time to research how to build a compiler and interpreter, and make it efficient.

    <h3>Minimalist</h3>

    <p>
      In my programming way, I find out that not because minimalist to do minimal life, but the life is minimal. So we need to Maximize the benefits of items, Make good use of its content, which is a better way to <b> minimalist</b>.
      <br><br>
      After that I keep research and thinking how to make a program (or app) more efficient and using less power, since my devices get to older. And making low end devices get a live is more meaningful and more environmentally friendly for me.
      <br><br>
      I called it “Low Power”-ism. check out <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y15THX1ZvHhQ6yB5WDyvCPZYVP8myQ-WayiSnE5ITnQ/edit?usp=sharing">Low Power Design Guidelines*</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://100r.co/site/mission.html">Hundred Rabbits' website who inspired me*</a>
